# About Me

Hi there. I’m Charlie. I live in San Francisco and write code, but that’s the boring bit. I’m at my best when on an adventure with my family. So I try to optimize for that.

This is me with a beard. I no longer have a beard.

## Work Stuff

Work-wise, I’m a frontend engineer (but I’ve also spent time in people management, and my team loved me — the team I led had a CultureAmp engagement score of 95%, which is one of the highest in the industry). I’m at [LaunchDarkly](https://launchdarkly.com), but past-me worked at Slack, IFTTT, and at an indie personal finance webapp I built called [PearBudget](https://pearbudget.com).

## This Tumblelog

I created the framework for this tumblelog (using [Eleventy](https://www.11ty.dev/)) because blogging had gotten boring. I had been feeling like things I wrote had to be *just right* to merit posting. That’s silly. So! A tumblelog.

If you’re interested in an Eleventy-based tumblelog like this one, you’re welcome to check out [the code](https://github.com/charliepark/tumblelog), though I need to polish it up a bit before it works out of the box.
