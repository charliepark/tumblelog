“[The Nikon Small World Competition](https://www.nikonsmallworld.com/) first began in 1975 as a means to recognize and applaud the efforts of those involved with photography through the light microscope. Since then, Small World has become a leading showcase for photomicrographers from the widest array of scientific disciplines.”
