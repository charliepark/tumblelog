# Lovers, 1988

by Félix González-Torres

![Two clocks, side by side, showing the same time](/images/perfect_lovers.jpg)

Don’t be afraid of the clocks,
  they are our time,
  time has been so generous to us.
We imprinted time with the sweet taste of victory.
We conquered fate by meeting at a certain time in a certain space.
We are a product of the time,
  therefore we give back credit were it is due: time. 

We are synchronized, now and forever.

I love you.
