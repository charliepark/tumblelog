![A gif showing a professor moving blocks to represent buildings of different heights, showing that buildings of different heights respond in different ways to earthquake waves of varying frequencies. A tall building will respond to low-frequency oscillations. A medium building will respond to medium-frequency oscillations. A short building will respond to high-frequency oscillations.](/images/seismic.gif)

A demonstration of the various responses from buildings of different heights to earthquake waves of varying frequencies.
