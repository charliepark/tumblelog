# SF Voting Cheatsheet

I’m a big fan of [The League of Pissed Off Voters](http://www.theleaguesf.org) and the guides they make each year. They have a more comprehensive guide on the way, but they’ve posted a [cheatcheet](http://www.theleaguesf.org/november_2020_cheat_sheet) in case you’re voting early.

I look forward to their more nuanced writeups on some of the propositions, but it’s good to have a general sense of their positions. I’m really hoping folks in District 1 pay attention and vote for [Connie Chan](conniechansf.com/).
