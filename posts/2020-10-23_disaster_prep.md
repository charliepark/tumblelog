Just as we can’t train for a marathon in a weekend, we shouldn’t approach disaster-proofing our houses as a single, massive project — doing so will almost guarantee it doesn’t happen. Even small steps can make a big difference, such as stocking bottled water, changing your flashlight batteries (and knowing where the flashlights are), agreeing on an external meeting place with family members, programming key numbers into your phone. To put it another way: If you know your cholesterol level, you should also know where your water shut-off valve is.
